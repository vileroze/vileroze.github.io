There would be two players playing alternately. One roll at a time.
Keep adding their scores until 51.
If their score is 49 before the next roll. They would need 2. To finish the game. If they score anything above 2, 
the number that is more than 51 would be reduced.
For example.
I am on 49 and on the next roll I roll 5.
My new total would be 49+5 = 54 which is 3 more than 51.
So my new total instead would be 51-3 (number that was more) = 48
The first one to score exact 51 would be the winner.
